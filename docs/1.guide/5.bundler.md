# Bundler usage

Typically `srvx` is to be imported link this.

```js
import { serve } from "srvx";
```

The import above, automatically resolves the the correct entrypoint for each runtime. Node.js, Deno and Bun use [ESM conditions](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html#resolution-algorithm-specification) to resolve the correct entrypoint.

If you are directly using `srvx` in your project without bundling or having `srvx` as a non-bundled `dependency` in `package.json` it should work as expected.

## Bundler usage

If unserve is being bundled (by for example [rollup](https://rollupjs.org/)), just during bundling the bundler also has to run the ESM resolution algorithm with a specific ESM condition. This will result `srvx` in the bundle to be only working with one specific runtime.

In order to avoid this, simplest way is to put `srvx` into the `externals` config.
